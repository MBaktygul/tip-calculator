## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I reviewed how to work with JavaScript functions and adding/removing classes. I wrote the code myself, but some functions weren't working, so I asked AI to refactor and clean up my code. I had a lot of redundant code, which made it long and confusing. 

I still need practice to get comfortable with writing JavaScrip.

## Acknowledgments

My mentor at work helped me with this challenge. We had regular meetings where he suggested the best approach to writing the code, explained how to implement certain parts, and provided clarifications whenever I had difficulty understanding how to approach the task. His guidance was invaluable in helping me navigate the challenge.
